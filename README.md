### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/t0m4s79/DREFleet.git
   cd DREFleet
   ```
2. **Environment setup**

   - Add **composer**, **nodejs** and **php** to your system's environment variables.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Fill in your database credentials in the newly created `.env` file.
   - Generate the Laravel application key with:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the Laravel directory and install backend and frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd laravel
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
   
4. **Run Database Migrations**

   Apply the database migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Start the Servers**

   If possible, to make things easier, open two terminals. One will run the backend server and the other one will run the frontend. Then, run the following commands:
   - Backend
      ```bash
      php artisan serve
      ```
   - Frontend
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
